# The Project

This project is a 3D gun selection system made with Unreal Engine blueprint, with a 3D static mesh that hold a gun and a widget that changes the character gun.

# Reference

My biggest reference was the AAA game CSGO, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - Firstly, I've created a socket in my character skeleton and made a preview to organize and to know the correct position.

2.0 - After that, I've just put the animation in the Character_BP and started to create the guns' logic, which consists of attaching, enabling, and disabling the visibility.

3.0 - For the finish, I've made a widget and a button logic to know when the mouse hovered them, to check what gun was selected.
